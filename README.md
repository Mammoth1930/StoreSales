# StoreSales

This is an application designed to take .csv files from a till and save the
information in a SQLite3 database. The information in the database can then be
exported to a .xlsx file with the quantity and value columns grouped by either
file extraction date, file extraction month or file extraction year.

This project was prompted by my brothers request, as he works at a small local
grocery store and was tired of having to manually save and export data dumps
from the till as .xlsx files.
